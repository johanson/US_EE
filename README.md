## Windows US International keyboard layout with AltGr/Caps mapping for Estonian characters

Run `/dist/setup.exe` and restart the computer. If you want to map CapsLock to AltGr for easier typing, run `remap_caps_to_altgr.reg` and restart the computer. Both need a restart anyway.

If it doesn't appear automatically, look for **US_IN_EE** keyboard layout in your keyboard settings.
